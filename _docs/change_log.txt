phpMussel change_log.txt

== CURRENT GOALS AND FUTURE VERSIONING GUIDELINES ==
SemVer will be used for phpMussel versioning from Version 1.0.0 and onwards.
Versioning guidelines for SemVer can be found at: http://www.semver.org/

Versions of phpMussel prior to 1.0.0, won't be using SemVer, but can be
interpreted via the following information.

The reason for this is, although I like the idea of using SemVer, I hadn't
discovered SemVer until after phpMussel was already at production stage and was
already used in live environments, and by that point, I'd already had a system
of my own making in use for phpMussel. This system of my own is adequately
similar to SemVer that I believe it should be a simple and easy task to convert
from one to the other, but I'm holding off switching until Version 1.0.0,
because it is recommended by SemVer that anything prior to Version 1.0.0 should
be considered pre-production stage (alpha, beta, etc) versions whereas anything
released after reaching production stage should be versioned as 1.0.0 and
onward, and although phpMussel is already in production stage live use, it
hasn't yet been iterated to Version 1.0.0 (v1.0), and so, I believe v1.0 of my
system would be the most appropriate time to switch to SemVer, versioning that
release as "Version 1.0.0" as per SemVer standard.

My system was a goal-oriented system, whereby the incremental increase was
based upon which pre-planned goals had been achieved and upon the perceived
importance of those goals. Not accounting for versions beyond v1.0, seeing as
I'll be switching to SemVer at that point anyhow, nor those goals already
completed, listed below are my current goals leading up to the switch (after
reaching Version 1.0.0, I'll remove these paragraphs and this explanation, as
they won't be relevant anymore after that point):

Do-to list for potential future major version (v1.0):

- Currently supported archive formats are BZ/BZ2, GZ, LZF, TAR and ZIP.
  At minimum, this should also extend to RAR, SHAR and 7z.
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues/2

- Currently, all formats for archive metadata signatures that are supported,
  with exception to ZIP format, can be scanned recursively. Ideally, ability to
  scan ZIP files recursively should also be supported at some point (along with
  all future formats that are planned to be supported).

- Wish list: Icon parsing.
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues/5

- Wish list: Certificate parsing.
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues/4

- Wish list: Establishing some sort of website.
  Refer spambotsecurity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=59&t=3441
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues/11

Do-to list for potential future minor version (v0.8):

- Any significant changes to the script including completing of any of the
  aforementioned above, whereby having done so, the release doesn't yet qualify
  as a major release. Definition of "significant" extends to the addition of
  any new major features and to the fixing of any bugs that could break normal
  functionality, but not to minor bug-fixes or to any signature updates.

Do-to list for potential future sub-minor version (v0.7b):

- Any non-significant changes or other unrelated changes to the core code, such
  as, for example, bug-fixes, as well as any other changes deemed to be of
  importance.

Anything less than sub-minor:

- Updates to signatures released without any changes to the core code,
  any changes deemed non-important, release candidates and anything else less
  than sub-minor (generally used as an excuse to mainline signature updates
  where no updates to the core script have been recently made).

=== Changes made since last versioned release ===

- [2015.08.20; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added one new "shorthand"
  entry (Malvertisement) [phpmussel.inc]; Slightly tweaked all the language
  files (a few small, non-significant corrections made).

- [2015.08.22; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translation of the
  documentation to Dutch (probably erroneous; feel free to audit if you want).

- [2015.08.24; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan/Vy]: Added language support for
  Vietnamese {Tiếng Việt} to the language data [lang.vi.inc].

- [2015.08.27; Signatures update; Maikuolan]: Removed a number of outdated
  signatures and added a significant number of new signatures covering a range
  of different malware types (about ~35K removed and ~40K added, roughly).

- [2015.09.11; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Corrected typecasting for a
  number of incorrectly typecasted configuration directives [phpmussel.inc;
  phpmussel.ini].

=== Version/Release 0.7a (Previous Release: 0.7) ===
SUB-MINOR RELEASE; Updated to the latest signatures set (55+20751+7a).

- [2015.07.15; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Merged a number of the
  signature sections of the core script to reduce on redundancy, resulting in
  roughly a ~15% reduction in the filesize of "phpmussel.inc".
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues/7

- [2015.07.15; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Bug found by DanielRuf whereby values
  returned by phpMussel(); were inconsistent between consecutive scans of the
  same file when those consecutive scans used different values for
  $output_type; Fixed.
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues/44

- [2015.07.15; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Found and fixed a bug whereby scanning
  individual files in CLI mode under Windows would sometimes produce a false
  positive as a result of the format of the directory tree.

- [2015.07.18; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Merged some more signature
  sections of the core script to reduce on redundancy and removed some
  unecessary and redundant variables.

- [2015.07.18; Sub-minor code change; DanielRuf]: Changing to short form for
  typecasting to integer to save on filesize; Corrected require statements to
  reflect the expected syntax for statements.

- [2015.07.19; Signatures update; Maikuolan]: Added various new signatures.

- [2015.07.19; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Slightly adjusted the Virus
  Total scanning logic; Added the new directive, `disable_cli`.

- [2015.07.22; Documentation; Maikuolan/DanielRuf]: The behaviour of the
  function phpMussel() in relation to its secondary input variable has been
  modified during the course of code changes brought about as of this version
  of phpMussel; This change is breaking for those that utilise additional
  implementations of this function beyond the default, but is non-breaking
  otherwise; Documentation has been updated accordingly.

- [2015.07.22; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Updated lang.inc; Added the
  new directive, `lang_acceptable`.

- [2015.07.25; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Changed the way that $vault
  is determined; As of now, $vault is determined automatically; Users are no
  longer required to manually set the $vault variable when installing or
  updating phpMussel.
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues/55

- [2015.07.27; Bug-fix; Maikuolan/DanielRuf]: Fixed a handful of small bugs
  found using PHPUnit.
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel-extras/issues/3

- [2015.07.30; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Bug found in the code for assigning
  variables through switch.dat; Fixed.

- [2015.08.01; Signatures update; Maikuolan]: Updated to the the latest
  signatures (55+20751+7a).

- [2015.08.05; Signatures update; Maikuolan]: Added various new signatures for
  protecting against webshells.

- [2015.08.05; Configuration; Maikuolan]: Added some new file extensions to the
  default for `filetype_blacklist`.

- [2015.08.05; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Bug found in the code for complex extended
  signatures whereby clusters of sequential signatures with similar initial
  conditions weren't differentiated as unique, individual signatures by the
  core code, being interpreted, rather, as singular signatures; Fixed.

- [2015.08.07; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added PHAR to the extensions
  recognised as potential PHP files by the code for PHP chameleon attack
  detections; Added the new directives `detect_adware`, `detect_joke_hoax`,
  `detect_pua_pup`, `detect_packer_packed`, `detect_shell` and `detect_deface`,
  to provide users of phpMussel with a way to instruct phpMussel to ignore
  those included signatures that may, in some circumstances, occasioanally be
  problematic for some users.

- [2015.08.08; Sub-minor code change and signatures update; Maikuolan]: Added
  numerous new shell signatures; Added numerous new forkbomb signatures;
  Modified the `vn_shorthand()` function and its entries; Added a new type of
  signature set and two accompanying signature files: PE extended signatures
  (`pex_custom.cvd`; `pex_mussel.cvd`); Added new CLI-mode functionality. PE
  extended signatures are matched against the size and MD5 hash of the content
  of variables within PE files. New CLI-mode functionality allows users to
  extract PE variable and PE section information from a PE file. For more
  details, refer to the documentation.

- [2015.08.10; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan/DanielRuf]: Added the
  `template_custom.html` file and added a few lines to code to allow phpMussel
  to switch between HTML template files based upon the presence of a `css_url`
  variable in the phpMussel configuration file; With this update, phpMussel now
  supports custom themes.
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues/22
  Refer github.com/DanielRuf/phpMussel-themes/issues/2

- [2015.08.14; Documentation]: Completed translation of the documentation to
  Russian.

=== Version/Release 0.7 (Previous Release: 0.6j; Next: 0.7a) ===
MINOR RELEASE; Updated to the latest signatures set (55+20665+7).

- [2015.06.17; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Completed work on
  "lang.ru.inc" (undoubtedly has mistakes; feel free to audit if you want).

- [2015.06.20; NEW FEATURE; Maikuolan]: Created and implemented a caching
  system to phpMussel! As of now, phpMussel is able to store information to and
  retrieve information from an internal cache between unique requests. There'll
  be a number of new features brought about as of this release that'll make use
  of this new caching system [phpmussel.inc].

- [2015.06.21; NEW FEATURE; Maikuolan]: phpMussel now stores the results of
  scanning in its internal cache, maintains these cache entries for the length
  of time specified by the `scan_cache_expiry` directive (newly created
  directive added to `phpmussel.ini`, defaulting to 21600 seconds, or 6 hours),
  after which, these cache entries will be cleared from the cache. When a new
  scan is initiated, phpMussel will check the cache for such entries, and if an
  entry exists corresponding to the file being scanned, the cached results will
  be returned, significantly reducing the time and processing power required by
  phpMussel to produce a result [phpmussel.inc; phpmussel.ini].

- [2015.06.22; NEW FEATURE; Maikuolan]: Integration with the Virus Total API
  has now been implemented! phpMussel is now able to optionally scan files
  using the Virus Total API, providing a greatly enhanced level of protection
  against viruses, trojans, malware and other threats. More information
  regarding this implementation is available via the documentation. Currently,
  phpMussel checks files against Virus Total using the MD5 hash of the file;
  Support for the actual uploading of files to Virus Total will implemented
  shortly [phpmussel.inc; phpmussel.ini].
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues/12

- [2015.06.23; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Updated English README (Virus Total
  information) [readme.en.txt; readme.en.md].

- [2015.06.23; Documentation; DanielRuf]: Updated German README (Virus Total
  information) [readme.de.txt; readme.de.md].

- [2015.06.23; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Updated Spanish README (Virus Total
  information) [readme.es.txt; readme.es.md].

- [2015.06.24; Sub-minor code change; Zangune]: Audited/Updated the language
  data in "lang.it.inc".

- [2015.06.24; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Updated French README (Virus Total
  information) [readme.fr.txt; readme.fr.md].

- [2015.06.25; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Updated Indonesian README (Virus
  Total information) [readme.id.txt; readme.id.md].

- [2015.06.26; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Newline character causing CRC mismatch
  during archive metadata checks; Fixed [phpmussel.inc].
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues/25

- [2015.06.27; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Updated Portuguese README (Virus
  Total information) [readme.pt.txt; readme.pt.md].

- [2015.06.29; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Improved the way that certain
  types of variables are enforced; Wrote new functions for bit-level analysis;
  Minor modification done to the code for RAR chameleon detection; Added new
  protections for archives: phpMussel is now able to detect and block encrypted
  ZIP archives (detection and blocking of other formats/types of encrypted
  archives should be supported shortly; refer to "block_encrypted_archives");
  Added the new directive, "lang_override", allowing the default language for
  phpMussel to be overridden on the basis of "HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE" (this is
  slightly bugged at the moment due to the way in which scan results are
  cached, whereby cached results may sometimes be served using the incorrect
  language if the correct language at the time of serving the cached results
  isn't the same as the correct language at the time of the original scan;
  this bug will be fixed shortly, but for now, it can be avoided by simply
  leaving this directive disabled).

- [2015.06.29; Signatures update; Maikuolan]: Added various new signatures.

- [2015.06.30; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Updated Italian README (Virus
  Total information) [readme.it.txt; readme.it.md].

- [2015.07.03; NEW FEATURE; Maikuolan]: Added support for TAR archives,
  allowing phpMussel to detect and scan files contained within TAR archives.
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues/1

- [2015.07.03; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Partially rewrote the code
  for handling GZ/BZ2/LZ files (I also intend to eventually rewrite the code
  for handling ZIP files at some point in the future, but haven't done so yet);
  Slightly modified the way in which filenames are encoded to logs as to
  slightly reduce on redundancy; Removed a small handful of redundant variables
  found within the core code; Added minor safeguards to the code for dealing
  with compressed files and archives for avoiding duplicate error messages that
  could've potentially been served in certain situations; One new language data
  entry added; Added a new testfile for testing TAR support (documentation
  updated accordingly) [metadata_testfile.tar].

- [2015.07.04; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Discovered a non-critical but significant
  inconsistency between the behaviour of phpMussel in relation to the integers
  returned upon encountering various errors during scanning and the
  documentation of that behaviour, and additionally, I found a non-critical bug
  in the behaviour of fail_silently; Fixed, and added a new directive for
  dealing with PHP extensions, "fail_extensions_silently"; All documentation
  updated accordingly. Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues/35

- [2015.07.09; Signatures update; Maikuolan]: Added various new PE signatures.

- [2015.07.10; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Found and fixed a bug whereby match lengths
  for certain particular CoEx signatures would occasionally be incorrectly
  interpreted.

- [2015.07.10; Signatures update; Maikuolan]: Updated to the the latest
  signatures (55+20665+7).

- [2015.07.12; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Bug found by DanielRuf whereby scan results
  wouldn't be correctly cached if the scan was triggered from outside of
  phpMussel (such as when the scan was initiated by the calling script); Fixed.
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues/39

=== Version/Release 0.6j (Previous Release: 0.6i; Next: 0.7) ===
SUB-MINOR RELEASE; Updated to the latest signatures set (55+20552+6j).

- [2015.05.24; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Code clean up (all script
  files affected); New language data entry (v0.6i.0a).

- [2015.05.24; Signatures update; Maikuolan]: Added a handful of new PE
  signatures and filename signatures (55+20451+6i.0a).

- [2015.05.24; Documentation + Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Updated the
  preamble of all documentation and updated the comments header sections of
  all script files to reflect the change of phpMussel now being hosted at
  GitHub; No changes to the actual working code (v0.6i.0b).

- [2015.05.24; Documentation; DanielRuf]: Fixed numbering in "readme.en.txt".

- [2015.05.24; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Found and corrected an incorrect function
  call (was using "str_len" instead of "strlen") within the code section for
  running phpMussel in honeypot mode. This bug would've likely prevented
  phpMussel from correctly saving quarantined copies of files while running in
  honeypot mode (but this bug would've only affected phpMussel strictly while
  running in honeypot mode).

- [2015.05.25; Format change; DanielRuf/Maikuolan]: All documentation, script
  files and etc, from this point onwards, to be formatted using UTF-8 without
  BOM instead of ANSI+entities (as was the case formerly).

- [2015.05.25; Documentation; DanielRuf]: Changed file encoding from ANSI to
  UTF-8 without BOM (all README files affected; code unaffected).

- [2015.05.25; Signatures update; Maikuolan]: Updated ClamAV PE Sectional
  signatures [20451->20503]; A small handful of other new signatures added and
  a small handful of duplicated/redundant/obsolete signatures removed.

- [2015.05.25; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: phpMussel now sets the
  `default_charset` and `mbstring.internal_encoding` to UTF-8 for the duration
  of its execution [phpmussel.inc]; Converted ANSI/ASCII data to UTF-8 without
  BOM and all HTML entities converted to UTF-8 data for improved readability
  and intelligibility [lang.inc]; New language data entries added [lang.inc;
  phpmussel.inc]; Amended some outdated information found in the comment header
  of the loader file [phpmussel.php] (v0.6i.0c).

- [2015.05.25; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Discovered and fixed broken revertion of
  defined error reporting level at the script exit [phpmussel.inc]; Discovered
  and fixed the failure to declare an appropriate language specification in the
  template file [phpmussel.inc; template.html]

- [2015.05.27; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added language support for
  Chinese {中文简体/中文傳統} to the language data [lang.inc] (v0.6i.0d).

- [2015.05.28; Documentation; DanielRuf]: Added example for hooking phpMussel
  using a `.htaccess` file to the documentation {EN/DE}.

- [2015.05.28; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Updated translations; Added example
  for hooking phpMussel using a `.htaccess` file to the documentation {the
  remainder}; Updated AV compatibility information.

- [2015.05.28; Signatures update; Maikuolan]: A small handful of other new
  signatures added and a small handful of falsing signatures removed.

- [2015.06.03; Documentation; DanielRuf]: Updated German README (fixed some
  typos, improved wording and grammar and translated some untranslated texts).

- [2015.06.04; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Very minor changes to the wording of
  some README files (added some contractions and attempted to remove some
  unnecessary words) and added some new information concerning some new changes
  I've made to phpMussel; Switching to lower-case filenames.

- [2015.06.04; Signatures update; Maikuolan]: Added a handful of new PE
  signatures and filename signatures (55+20451/20503+6i.0e).

- [2015.06.04; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: The language data of
  "lang.inc" has been split based upon the languages contained therein to a
  handful of different files that've since been created and placed within a
  "%phpmussel%/vault/lang/" directory; This should allow for easier
  modification of the language data and make updating a smoother process when
  more than one developer or translator is working on translating that data at
  the same time; Significant modifications done to -all- script files;
  Improvement in the way that language data is parsed by phpMussel; Added
  multiple new entries to the language data; All language data updated; Added
  support for Japanese {日本語} and Russian {Русский}, although both are
  incomplete at this time; More added support to come in the near future
  (v0.6i.0e).

- [2015.06.08; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Corrected a minor comment
  error found in the configuration file; Did some more work on some of the
  language files {JA/RU}, but there's still a great deal to be done;
  Auto-updater stabilised {but changes not yet tested live}; Began pushing out
  a new round of signature updates in preparing for the next release, but I
  haven't yet finished doing this {didn't have enough time to finish doing this
  today/tonight; will finish it tomorow}.

- [2015.06.08; Sub-minor code change; DanielRuf]: Updated the language data in
  "lang.de.inc".

- [2015.06.08; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Corrected a small code typo
  in the auto-updater [update.inc] (v0.6i.0f).

- [2015.06.09; Signatures update; Maikuolan]: Updated to the the latest
  signatures (55+20552+6j); Switch file updated [switch.dat].

- [2015.06.09; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Completed work on
  "lang.ja.inc"; Added some more "shorthand" entries [phpmussel.inc].

- [2015.06.10; Sub-minor code change; DanielRuf]: Removed unnecessary HTML
  entities and improved template to prevent wrapping text [template.html].

- [2015.06.12; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Adding a "README.md" and a
  "CONTRIBUTING.md" file to the repository; Some very minor tweaks done to the
  documentation.

- [2015.06.15; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed adding markdown versions of
  the README documentation to the repository. README documentation is now
  available both in plain-text and markdown formats.

- [2015.06.15; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added chameleon attack
  detection for WEBP files [phpmussel.inc].

- [2015.06.15; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Discovered that the chameleon attack
  detection for photoshop (PSD and PDD) files wasn't triggering correctly;
  Fixed [phpmussel.inc] (v0.6j).

Maikuolan,
15th June 2015.

=== Version/Release 0.6i (Previous Release: 0.6h; Next: 0.6j) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+20451+6i).
Sub-minor release (medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- 2015.04.25 [Non-ClamAV signatures 6h.0a+]: New signatures added for dealing
  with macro keylogger droppers, new ransomware variants and a few related
  miscellaneous other threats.
- 2015.05.01: Added a new testfile for testing against the SWF signatures sets.
- 2015.05.06: Did some minor cleaning up of code (all script files affected)
  for slightly reduced filesize, slightly reduced redundancy and slightly
  increased efficiency.
- 2015.05.08: Added a new matching method for CoEx signatures.
- 2015.05.19: Added support for signature weighting (this means that phpMussel
  can now support signatures intended to detect suspicious or potentially
  malicious qualities of files being uploaded without necessarily flagging
  those files as being malicious, and then make a decision as to whether or not
  to flag those files as being malicious based on the number - or "weight" - of
  those suspicious or potentially malicious qualities; this can be potentially
  very useful for certain types of heuristic detections). Associated
  configuration directive added to the phpMussel configuration file for the
  purpose of determining at which weight a file will be flagged as malicious;
  This value will default to 3 when not otherwise defined.
- 2015.05.20: As per usual, all documentation updated to reflect the changes
  brought about as of this release.
- 2015.05.22 [signatures 55+20451+6i+]: Updated to the the latest signatures.

Maikuolan,
22nd May 2015.

=== Version/Release 0.6h (Previous Release: 0.6g; Next: 0.6i) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+20309+6h).
Sub-minor release (high or medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- 2015.03.28 [Non-ClamAV signatures 6g.0b+]: Some new signatures added for
  dealing with Office macro droppers and a few related miscellaneous others.
- 2015.03.30 [Non-ClamAV signatures 6g.0c+]: More than 800+ new signatures
  added for dealing with Equation Group malware!
- 2015.04.09 [Non-ClamAV signatures 6g.0d+]: Small handful of new signatures
  added dealing with PE trojans such as that of Torrent Locker, and some new JS
  trojan dropper signatures added (Crypto Locker, CTB Locker, etc).
- 2015.04.10: A shout-out and thank you to John Thaler, friend and graphics
  designer <http://jthalerdesign.com/>, for designing a rather well-fitting
  mascot-style graphical icon for phpMussel; Something I've always liked the
  idea of having done, but which has always been slightly outside of my own
  personal expertise for doing (I've always been more of a PHP coder than a
  graphics designer). The new icon is now being displayed on the Sourceforge
  page for phpMussel and should now be displayed alongside Sourceforge listings
  for phpMussel and similar such listings elsewhere.
- 2015.04.12 [signatures 55+20309+6h+]: Updated to the the latest ClamAV
  signatures; SecuriteInfo signatures; PhishTank signatures; Others and etc.
- 2015.04.12 [0.6h+]: Slightly improved the way in which phpMussel determines
  the potential content within some certain particular types of files and the
  way in which phpMussel handles those particular types of files, resulting in
  a slight performance improvement and in a reduction of the occurrence of
  certain types of theoretical but unconfirmed false positives. The presence of
  a new file within the package, "switch.dat", is connected to this particular
  update.
- 2015.04.13: As per usual, all documentation updated to reflect the changes
  brought about as of this release.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- If you allow the uploading of PE (Portable Executable; EXEs) files, then,
  this update should be considered extremely high priority, due to the risk
  posed by Equation Group malware and the presence of new signatures within
  this release for protecting against that malware (the risk posted by that
  malware is significant, but the new signatures protecting against that
  malware only concerns PE files anyhow, and other vectors aren't affected).
- Updating to this release from the previous release (0.6g) should otherwise be
  considered medium priority.
- Due to the auto-updater being available again as of the previous release,
  updating to this release from the previous release can be done manually (by
  downloading the latest available package of phpMussel from
  Sourceforge) or can be done via the auto-updater (either option is equally
  viable). If you need help setting up this functionality beyond that offered
  by the documentation, feel free to contact me.
- At the time of this latest release, the total size for the supplementary
  signatures provided by SecuriteInfo are well over 50MBs and number more than
  500,000 individual signatures. Whilst this is fantastic news for users of
  ClamAV, this is, unfortunately, on top of those signatures already
  implemented by phpMussel prior to the inclusion of these supplementary
  signatures, somewhat too much for phpMussel to handle, given the limitations
  of phpMussel mentioned and/or discussed in the past (such as the upper memory
  limit of PHP and the maximum allowable memory available to PHP for processing
  tasks as per allowed both by many shared hosting services and by PHP itself).
  As such, the number of individual supplementary signatures provided by
  SecuriteInfo that I've opted to actually implement into phpMussel are a
  significantly limited and reduced sub-set of those actually available for
  implementation. In an ideal world, for the purposes of maximum protection,
  I'd be implementing the entirety of those available for implementation, but
  on consideration of the limitations that exist, the limited and reduced
  sub-set that has been implemented is, as has been the case in the past, my
  attempt to balance as best is possible between effectiveness of protections
  and efficiency of phpMussel as a whole, or in other words, offering the best
  possible within the confines of those limitations that do, unfortunately,
  exist.

=== Version/Release 0.6g (Previous Release: 0.6f; Next: 0.6h) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+20213+6g).
Sub-minor release (medium or high priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- Some new signatures dealing with website defacements added (2015.03.16).
- A few signatures that were occasionally falsing were narrowed (2015.03.19).
- New banking trojan and ransomware signatures added (2015.03.20).
- The auto-updater is back online!! Offline since v0.6, I've rewritten most of
  the actual code for the auto-updater, and it should now work again as
  expected. I still haven't sorted out alternative mirrors, but, the updater
  now sources its updates directly from Sourceforge, and I haven't yet
  encountered any problems with the way in which I've recoded the updater nor
  with the way in which updates are being sourced; If any such problems
  eventually emerge, time will tell. However, it should now be possible to
  safely use the auto-updater once again (2015.03.20).
- Behavioural changes: Previously, if the auto-updater was used and an update
  was found to be available for download, the auto-updater would attempt to
  download and install the entirety of the available update, regardless of
  whether or not specific files within that update were actually required by
  the specific installation of phpMussel for which the auto-updater was
  attempting to update. Now, if a particular file within an installation is
  already up to-date and doesn't differ from that of its counter-part within
  an available update, the auto-updater won't need to re-download or reinstall
  that particular file. Additionally, files associated with any type of
  signatures that are explicitly disabled by way of their associated directives
  within the phpMussel configuration being explicitly disabled won't be
  downloaded and installed (however, they will nonetheless still be downloaded
  and installed if their associated directives are missing entirely from
  the phpMussel configuration). The update scheduling aspect of the
  auto-updater, or the concept of the auto-updater checking for updates "too
  quickly" (whichever of the two you'd prefer), has now been rendered obsolete,
  and as such, because it is no longer required, support for the "forcedupdate"
  optional parameter has now been removed. Prior recommendations of checking
  for updates at least once per month but no more than twice per month still
  stand, but they are no longer enforced at all. Release/version numbers are
  now entirely arbitrary where the auto-updater is concerned: They are still
  nonetheless checked for and declared upon using the auto-updater, but whether
  or not an update is available is now determined by file hashes rather than
  release/version numbers. No other changes or modifications have been made to
  the auto-updater (2015.03.20).
- As per usual, all documentation updated to reflect the changes brought about
  as of this version release (2015.03.21).
- All four files containing PHP code (the Loader, "phpmussel.php", the Language
  Data, "lang.inc", the Updater, "update.inc", and the Core Script,
  "phpmussel.inc") have been modified since the previous release. The changes
  made to the Updater and to Core Script are as described above. Language data
  has been updated accordingly. No changes have been made to the actual code
  of the Loader, but some of the comment text at the beginning of the file has
  been modified (2015.03.22).
- Updated to the the latest ClamAV signatures; SecuriteInfo signatures;
  PhishTank signatures; All other signatures and etc (2015.03.22).

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- The signature name packing that I'd introduced with the previous release of
  phpMussel had broken some of the signature bypasses that I'd hardcoded into
  the core script, resulting in an increase of false positives for certain
  types of files when scanning; An unfortunate oversight that I'd discovered
  earlier today and managed to fix fairly easily immediately thereafter.
  Theoretically, certain instances of whitelisting may have broken, too, though
  that isn't something that I'd tested. Either way, however, the problem should
  be resolve as of this release (2015.03.18).

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- Updating to this release from the previous release (0.6f) should be
  considered high priority if you use or intend to use the auto-updater, but
  should otherwise be considered medium priority.

Maikuolan,
22nd March 2015.

=== Version/Release 0.6f (Previous Release: 0.6e; Next: 0.6g) ===
SUMMARY:
Non-ClamAV signatures update only (55+20139+6f).
Sub-minor release (low or medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- I've found a way to -slightly- decrease the amount of disc-space required by
  the signatures files by way of partially packing signatures names. As this
  doesn't involve any changes to the actual format or syntax used by any of the
  various types of signatures and as this partial packing of signatures names
  is entirely optional (whether or not it's used will have no effect on the way
  in which signatures are processed or on the way in which phpMussel operates),
  this change is entirely backwards-compatible. This will very slightly impact
  human-readability of the signatures files, but not to a critical degree and
  not to a level that should prevent work from being done on signatures files.
  This packing absolutely will not be utilised for anything other than the
  names of signatures, as trying to do this on the signatures themselves would
  most likely heavily affect the processing requirements of phpMussel (because
  it would need to unpack each signature and/or signature set prior to running
  checks against them which could potentially be a severe drain on resources
  for the systems phpMussel would be running from), but as for the names,
  unpacking isn't required unless there's an actual positive hit returned upon
  doing checks and thus doing this for names shouldn't hinder system resources
  and shouldn't impede phpMussel at all. The overall reduction in the amount of
  disc-space required per installation is dependent upon the exact
  configuration of each installation and of which files are in use by that
  installation, but on a complete installation making use of all files as per
  is available in the phpMussel package, the total reduction should be about
  5% (not a lot, but it's something). The most significantly affected signature
  set is that of the PE Sectional signatures, experiencing a total reduction of
  about 20% in disc-space required, the benefit of which is that I should now
  be able to add about ~70,000 or so additional signatures to the PE Sectional
  signatures set than I previously could without going over the 21MB cap limit
  that I'd set for the sake of avoiding memory problems for PHP (2015.03.08).
- I've gone through the signatures and found a new round of obsolete signatures
  that have thus been removed as of this release (2015.03.08).
- New CVE signatures for an RTF vulnerability written and added (2015.03.09).

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- Updating to this release from the previous release (0.6e) should be
  considered medium priority if you allow the uploading of PE files (EXE) or
  RTF files to your website or server, or if you've experienced minor
  disc-space problems with either the previous or another recent release of
  phpMussel, but should otherwise be considered low priority.

=== Version/Release 0.6e (Previous Release: 0.6d; Next: 0.6f) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+20139+6e).
Sub-minor release (low or medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- Added a new detection method within the capabilities of the Complex Extended
  signatures: Checking against metadata (or, checking against the "data about
  data" of files to be scanned by phpMussel). I'll likely expand on this into
  the future, but for the time being, the new signatures introduced with this
  release of phpMussel that make use of this new detection method are looking
  at the names of the sections of PE files to look for signs suggestive of
  malware, malware packers and other such unwanted items, as well as other
  such metadata related things to be found in PE files. Potential future
  applications of this direction could include (but aren't limited to)
  evidence of infections within various multimedia files and any other
  infectable files that either contain data about themselves within themselves
  or for which such data could be potentially derived (though I'm yet to code
  for such things; perhaps this is something that could be done in the
  future, if a need for such a thing arises? 2015.02.22).
- Very minor rewording of several lines within the Language Data (2015.02.26).
- Completed translation of the documentation to Spanish, which, assuming I've
  done it correctly and assuming that it's intelligible, would mean that
  phpMussel now fully supports seven languages (English, German, French,
  Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, and now Spanish), with partial support for
  one more (Dutch). Taking in mind that my native language is English and that
  I don't actually understand or speak fluently any other languages, any
  double-checking, proof-reading and/or verification by anyone that might know
  better than I do so far as any given language is concerned would be both
  welcomed and appreciated, because, although I've done as best I can for those
  that I've done myself (short of paying money for them or seeking external
  help) to make sure that they've been done as correctly as possible, until
  someone that knows better takes a look and says so one way or the other,
  ultimately, I won't know for sure if I've gotten it right or not. Hopefully,
  fingers crossed, they're intelligible, and I can't see any immediate errors
  myself, but, if anyone is willing, feel free to take a look and let me know
  if I've gotten anything wrong.
  Refer spambotsecurity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=57&t=2929 (2015.03.03).

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- Updating to this release from the previous release (0.6d) should be
  considered medium priority if you allow the uploading of PE files (EXE) to
  your website or server, but should otherwise be considered low priority.
- Getting the updater operational again is still on the to-do list, but I
  haven't yet touched that at all since previously mentioned about.

=== Version/Release 0.6d (Previous Release: 0.6c; Next: 0.6e) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+20058+6d).
Sub-minor release (low or medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- There are a large number of new PE Sectional signatures and new hash-based
  signatures targeting PE files, as well as a small handful of CVE signatures
  and a small number of relatively recent zero-days included with this
  release (2015.02.17).
- Updated to the latest ClamAV signatures (2015.02.17); Release slightly
  delayed due to the time requirements of testing the latest release against
  false positives, which was slightly longer this time than was originally
  anticipated.
- Added the ability to check against the number of PE sections that exist
  within a PE file within complex extended signatures; Variable generated
  within the Core Script at the point where PE Sectional signatures checking
  occurs, thus, PE Sectional signatures checking must be enabled for this to
  work correctly; This will help with the detection of certain known viruses
  that affect PE files, though, currently, a limited number of signatures make
  use of this variable, thus, the scope is limited at this time (2015.02.20).

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- Updating to this release from the previous release (0.6c) should be
  considered medium priority if you allow the uploading of PE files (EXE), PDF
  documents (PDF), Shockwave files (SWF) or macro-enabled documents (such as
  those of Microsoft Word, DOC, DOCX, and such) to your website or server, but
  should otherwise be considered low priority.

=== Version/Release 0.6c (Previous Release: 0.6b.2; Next: 0.6d) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+19989+6c).
Sub-minor release (high priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- Removed a small handful of older signatures written for viruses and malware
  that no longer exists and/or doesn't affect any known currently operable
  systems (2015.01.23).
- Added a small handful of new signatures targeting HTML files containing code
  associated with paypal phishing (2015.01.23).
- Massive addition of new hash-based signatures targeting PE files compliments
  of the SecuriteInfo signatures update for this release (2015.01.26).
- I've been doing more performance experiments in the hopes of finding more
  ways to improve on phpMussel, specifically, looking for further ways to
  improve the balance between the effectiveness of its defences and the
  efficiency and speed at which it applies those defences and performs scans.
  As part of that, rather than capping ClamAV PE Sectional signatures at a flat
  300,000 of the latest such signatures, I opted to try, as of this version,
  capping it at 21MBs worth of the latest such signatures (so doing it by
  filesize rather than the actual number of signatures). The pe_clamav.cvd file
  was beginning to come close to that filesize as it was anyhow, and
  considering that the problems with including the entirety of the PE Sectional
  signatures set was that the large size of that number of signatures would add
  significantly to that of to the pe_clamav.cvd file and the fact that such a
  large size would not be possible for PHP to process correctly under normal
  circumstances and thus cause PHP to crash whenever that set would be loaded,
  resulting in phpMussel failing to complete scans, I think doing it by
  filesize rather than the actual number of signatures would bring it more in
  line with the purposes of why it was being capped in the first place. This
  also means that the number of PE Sectional sections as of this version is
  slightly larger than the previous version (312,024 rather than 300,000), and
  that the exact number may change both upwards and downwards slightly between
  releases. I think the balance is slightly better now as of this release. If
  anyone does detect any problems, however, I'd ask that they notify me of
  these problems as so that I may improve phpMussel further and hopefully
  resolve any such problems for future releases and further improve on that
  balance (so far, local testing hasn't demonstrated any problems, but such
  problems can be dependent on environmental factors, too) (2015.01.31).
- Added a number of new VBS signatures (2015.02.02).
- Updated to the the latest ClamAV signatures; PhishTank signatures; All other
  signatures and etc (2015.02.02).
- I've modified the Core script in such a way as to allow me to do some further
  narrowing on those signatures belonging to the ClamAV General, ASCII and HTML
  signatures sets; Those signatures, previously, were checked against any
  non-whitelisted files targeted for scanning, regardless of whether or not any
  particular signatures within those sets were actually supposed to be
  targeting the specific filetypes and other such details of the
  non-whitelisted files targeted for scanning, whereas now, those signatures,
  where they are supposed to be targeting some specific filetype or other such
  specific thing, and where I've been able to identify what it actually is,
  should now only be checking against non-whitelisted files targeted for
  scanning for which they are supposed to be targeting. This, I've done, for
  the sake of attempting to improve the performance and efficiency of
  phpMussel, for which I've been trying to better the balance for.
  Unfortunately, there were a significant number of those signatures where I
  wasn't able to identify what it was that they were actually supposed to be
  targeting, of which I've removed from phpMussel for this particular release
  and for consequent releases until such a time that I'm able to identify what
  it was they were actually supposed to be targeting. I don't think this should
  dent the defensive capabilities of phpMussel too much if even at all, given
  that most of those removed signatures were fairly old by this point and
  didn't seem to be targeting anything that I'd foresee being likely to be
  uploaded via a website or webform, but, if anyone does find any problems
  relating to their removal, do please let me know. In any case, I do believe
  these removals and further narrowing have resulted in a noticeable
  improvement in performance and efficiency (2015.02.02).
- Added a handful of new signatures to deal with "RansomWeb", a form of
  ransomware specifically targeting websites (2015.02.03).

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- Yesterday, I ran an extensive check with phpMussel against ~100,000 known
  clean files associated with various aspects of the Windows operating system,
  in an attempt to gauge current performance specs for phpMussel. In the
  process of doing so, I'd found that a number of the signatures that I'd
  written that were specifically targeting malicious PHP scripts were
  generating false positives for a significant number of different PE files,
  for which they shouldn't have been triggering for at all. To deal with this,
  I've added some extra checks and validations to the core script that should
  hopefully reduce the chances of this sort of thing happening (2015.01.20).
- Detected as per the same way as above, I've removed a small number of other
  target non-specific signatures and PE signatures that were causing false
  positives (2015.01.20).
- Found a bug within the Core Script in how the signature mapping code
  iterates through lines of signatures, as such that the final signature line
  of any given mapping section would be entirely ignored by the Core Script.
  This meant that although the majority of signatures were still being parsed
  correctly, there were at least a few hundred signatures within each of the
  affected signatures set that weren't being parsed at all. Although the fix
  itself was simple, due to the implications of this bug, I'm marking this
  release as high priority. Only those specifically of the ClamAV signature
  sets that made use of the mapping code were affected by this bug, and all
  other signature sets were unaffected (2015.02.04).

=== Version 0.6b / Release 0.6b.2 (Previous Release: 0.6b.1; Next: 0.6c) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+19916+6b.2).
Language Data updated; No other script files modified (low priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- Slightly updated language data (2015.01.11).
- Large number of new signatures targeting malicious PE files added.
- Narrowed a number of MD5-based signatures.
- Updated to the the latest ClamAV signatures; PhishTank signatures; All other
  signatures and etc.

=== Version 0.6b / Release 0.6b.1 (Previous Release: 0.6b; Next: 0.6b.2) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+19868+6b.1).
No script changes (low priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- Slightly narrowed some of the android malware signatures (2014.12.30).
- One of the regular members of Spambot Security posted a link on the forums to
  an article on a blog operated by Fox IT, describing a trojan seemingly
  intended for blackhat SEO practises, written in PHP and targeting popular
  CMS such as Wordpress and Joomla. The article therein contained a link to a
  Github page operated by the same group containing a list of hashes to
  identify a number of found variants of this particular trojan, that I've
  opted to use to write some new signatures for phpMussel for the purposes of
  detecting this particular trojan. As this particular trojan tends to reach
  systems via bundling with pirated commercial themes for popular CMS, the
  chances of this trojan entering your system via a file upload are extremely
  small, but these signatures could nonetheless prove useful for CMS-wide scans
  by phpMussel for malware and for scanning in CLI-mode. As such, phpMussel
  should now be capable of detecting this particular trojan, known as
  CryptoPHP. That said, the lesson to be learned from the discovery of this
  trojan is to avoid using pirated content with your CMS (2015.01.02)!
- Updated to the the latest ClamAV signatures; PhishTank signatures; All other
  signatures and etc (2015.01.02).

=== Version/Release 0.6b (Previous Release: 0.6a; Next: 0.6b.1) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+19837+6b).
Sub-minor release (medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- Added a significant number of new signatures from multiple sources dealing
  with rootkits, viruses and trojans, covering a range of platforms and
  infection vectors (2014.12.20).
- Detected and removed a significant number of unnecessary duplicate signatures
  and unnecessary sub-set signatures (2014.12.20).
- Removed a number of outdated signatures that no longer have relevance to any
  current threats (2014.12.20).
- Added a significant number of new VBS signatures via CoEx (2014.12.24).
- Added a directive to allow filetype extension based greylisting. I'd
  absolutely recommend for those users of phpMussel that have a definitive idea
  of exactly what filetypes they do and don't want to allow onto their
  webservers to make use of this new directive: Extensions cited by this
  directive are those extensions that are allowed, but which should still
  nonetheless be scanned, whereas any extensions not cited by this directive
  will be treated as blacklisted and thus not permitted to be uploaded.
  Omission of this directive will cause it to be ignored. Refer to the
  documentation for more details such as the logical order of processing
  (2014.12.25).
- Updated to the the latest ClamAV signatures; PhishTank signatures; All other
  signatures and etc (2014.12.25).
- I've found some new 32-bit infected PE files that weren't detected by ClamAV
  that I've written some signatures for via CoEx (2014.12.26).
- Previous version of phpMussel, there weren't any regex-based ClamAV PDF
  signatures in the ClamAV database, and thus, the code for handling PDF
  signatures was slightly more compact than the code for handling other
  signature types. A few regex-based ClamAV PDF signatures have emerged,
  however, during my most recent processing of the ClamAV database. As such,
  the code for handling PDF signatures has been brought into line with the code
  for handling other signature types (2014.12.27).
- As per usual, all documentation updated to reflect the changes brought about
  as of this version release (2014.12.27).
- Although phpMussel has already proven to be effective in various live
  environments and although I've not personally received any complaints thus
  far in regards to its effectiveness, I'm still not entirely satisfied that
  I've thus far struck quite as right a balance between effectiveness of
  protections provided and efficiency of the scanning process as I potentially
  could (basically, I think scanning still takes much longer than it should for
  certain files in certain circumstances; in particular, PE files above a
  certain filesize), and thus, again, I've been tinkering around with
  signatures mapping and the signatures themselves. Although there has been
  an increase in the number of signatures dealing with specific types of files
  and an increase in hash-based signatures (hash-based signatures are processed
  exceptionally quickly by phpMussel and do not concern me so far as the time
  requirements of scanning are concerned) in this release since the previous
  release, you may notice a somewhat significant decrease in the number of
  General (general_*) signatures (signatures that are always processed
  regardless of what is being uploaded or scanned) and the number of PE (exe_*)
  signatures in this release since the previous release. The decrease comes
  from a removal of, firstly, a significant number of PE/W32 packer signatures
  (these signatures would be useful for Windows-based PC anti-virus solutions
  in protecting against malicious executables, and although there is still
  relevance for these signatures in a PHP-based anti-virus solution such as
  phpMussel, I'd suggest the relevance is somewhat less-so, and given that the
  risk associated with these files is primarily for the user of Windows-based
  PCs and systems and less-so for webservers [although not entirely absent for
  webservers; especially Windows-based webservers], it is nonetheless less-so,
  but also given that most of these signatures are for PUPs [Potentially
  Unwanted Programs], PUAs [Potentially Unwanted Applications] and speculative
  threats, rather than definitive threats, given that they generate far more
  false positives than any other signatures I've encountered during testing
  and given the significant performance and speed increase for phpMussel by
  removing these signatures which sees scanning completed almost twice as
  quickly as it otherwise would be, I feel that the removal of these signatures
  contributes positively towards getting closer to the ideal balance between
  effectiveness of protections provided and efficiency of the scanning
  process; additionally, if, within a given installation of phpMussel, EXEs are
  blacklisted, the EXE directive is disabled or EXE files are otherwise not
  intended for uploading, these signatures won't be useful for phpMussel at all
  anyhow), secondly, a number of signatures targeting DOS-based viruses (there
  are still DOS viruses floating around the internet, but I can't offhandedly
  think of any DOS-based webservers that are still online today, nor do I think
  that there are likely many internet users that frequently browse the internet
  from DOS machines, so the immediate threat of these particular viruses is
  less-so than those viruses targeting more modern systems, thus, when looking
  for ways to whittle down the overall bulk of General and PE signatures,
  signatures such as these become a prime target for removal), and thirdly,
  various other signatures I found that were either outdated, not triggering
  correctly or that didn't have any or much relevance to the intended use of
  phpMussel. Since doing this, the performance of phpMussel has improved, and
  it's now closer to striking the right balance, but still isn't perfect, so
  I may yet and probably will do more of this sort of thing into the future,
  but in any case, there is an improvement (2014.12.28).

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- Found that the shockwave signatures were using an incorrect whitelisting
  flag; Fixed (2014.12.14).

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- Core script modified, but no changes have been made to the Update script or
  the Language data between this release and the previous.
- Ignore the commented out code blocks that you may notice having been
  introduced to the Core script as of this release. They're my attempts at
  adding something new that doesn't quite yet work as intended, and may or
  may not yet eventuate into anything. Don't uncomment them, because they'll
  do more harm than good if they go live in their current state.
- There are still plenty of things on my to-do list and yet again I've had
  plenty of ideas for things that I still want to do with phpMussel, but
  there'll probably always be new ideas, at least into the foreseeable future,
  and for the time being, I really wanted to get the latest signatures updates
  and other various changes done thus far to the userbase of phpMussel without
  unnecessary delays, so, I'm releasing this version/release now, rather than
  later.

=== Version/Release 0.6a (Previous Release: 0.6; Next: 0.6b) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+19735+6a).
Sub-minor release (medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- Added ability for the use of negative clauses with triggering signatures
  based upon the content of variables available to the scope of the core
  scanning functionality (2014.11.25).
- Added a few new minor PHP malware obfuscation signatures (2014.11.29).
- Updated to the the latest ClamAV signatures; PhishTank signatures; All other
  signatures and etc (2014.12.06).

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- In testing of the previous version consequent to its release, I'd discovered
  that attempted file uploads successfully blocked due to archive metadata
  signatures and to signatures of that type alone, weren't being parsed at all
  to the quarantine function. This is not a threat in any way, but rather, an
  oversight that simply would've made it slightly more difficult to debug
  any blocked uploads blocked due to that signature type in the event that
  debugging was required, but nonetheless, those files would still be blocked
  correctly. Anyhow, I've made a point of immediately fixing it (2014.11.25).

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- As per mentioned within the change_log information for the previous release,
  I'd intended to completely overhaul the updater at some point or another. I
  haven't yet made a start on doing this, but still intend to do so at some
  point (2014.12.05).
- The domains for which I'd cited in documentation and in the archive comment
  regarding a "contact form" for contacting me as well as regarding an email
  address for seeking support, I've chosen to allow to elapse, because beyond
  those particular things, they no longer served any purpose for me, and the
  renewal date for those domains has come about. I may or may not register new
  domains for phpMussel; At this point, I don't think it's necessary and
  wouldn't really serve any useful purpose, but if a need for it emerges at
  some point in the future, I'll do so. In consideration of this, I've removed
  any references to these domains from the documentation and archive comments
  as of this release (2014.12.05).

=== Version/Release 0.6 (Previous Release: 0.5c; Next: 0.6a) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+19659+6).
Minor release (high priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- As of this version, I've introduced a new type of signature set that I'm
  labelling as "complex extended" (or CoEx) signatures. The idea behind complex
  extended signatures is that there may, at times, be threats that we'll want
  to be identifying using multiple detection methods, to catch those threats
  while reducing the risk of false positives where there are multiple matching
  methods possible for particular threats but where using only one of those
  methods at any given time would be likely to produce false positives, or
  perhaps to catch a threat that would be particularly difficult to catch using
  only a single method, due to difficult or tedious fingerprinting or for
  similar such reasons. Complex extended signatures, basically, consist of a
  series of often different matching methods and matching queries whereby each
  query is required to either match or not match in order to generate a
  positive on the signature. Many of ClamAV's "logical signatures" work in a
  similar way, and having not had any directly equivalent functionality in
  phpMussel to the ClamAV engine's functionality dealing with logical
  signatures, the complex extended signatures functionality of phpMussel is an
  approximate functionality that I've now introduced that'll allow to
  appropriately adapt a decent portion (though not all) of the ClamAV logical
  signatures, which I hadn't previously done. Refer to the documentation for a
  more detailed explanation if you are interested in knowing more (2014.11.12).
- Added a new testfile for the purposes of testing the new complex extended
  signatures (2014.11.12).
- With special thanks to SecuriteInfo.com for their work in developing
  supplementary signatures for ClamAV <http://securiteinfo.com/>, with their
  permission, I'm now including a selection of signatures from their signatures
  database with phpMussel as of this release (note: permission is for the free
  version of their database and does not extend to the paid version of their
  database). These signatures can be found within the "coex_mussel.cvd" file of
  phpMussel as part of that new functionality (2014.11.13).
- Added a few new minor chameleon attack detections (2014.11.13).
- Added a few new detections for theoretical attacks (2014.11.13).
- I've implemented a number of new signatures to protect against malware
  targeting Android phones and systems (2014.11.15).
- I've implemented a significant number of new signatures to protect against
  malware targeting PDF and BAT files (2014.11.15).
- I've successfully implemented quarantine functionality to phpMussel, meaning
  that, as of this release of phpMussel, it is possible to safely quarantine
  flagged attempted file uploads in isolation within the phpMussel vault. Due
  to potential risks with this functionality if not used correctly or if not
  used within the correct environment, this new functionality is disabled by
  default, but can be enabled by entering in some value to the "quarantine_key"
  directive of the phpMussel configuration. Casual users of phpMussel of which
  simply wish to protect their websites or hosting environment without having
  any interest in deeply analysing any flagged attempted file uploads should
  leave this functionality disabled, but any users interested in further
  analysis of flagged attempted file uploads for malware research or for
  similar such things should enable this functionality. Please refer to the
  documentation for further information (2014.11.15).
- Updated the future goals and versioning guidelines included in this
  change_log document (2014.11.15).
- I've successfully implemented honeypot functionality to phpMussel, meaning
  that, as of this release of phpMussel, it is possible (if you choose to do
  so) to run phpMussel as a virus/malware honeypot. This new functionality is
  disabled by default, but can be enabled via the phpMussel configuration file
  by enabling "honeypot_mode". When honeypot mode is enabled, phpMussel will
  attempt to quarantine every single file upload that it encounters, regardless
  of whether or not the file being uploaded matches any included signatures,
  and no actual scanning or analysis of those attempted file uploads will
  actually occur. This functionality should be useful for those that wish to
  use phpMussel for the purposes of virus/malware research, but it is neither
  recommended to enable this functionality if the intended use of phpMussel by
  the user is for actual file upload scanning nor is it recommended to use
  the honeypot functionality for purposes other than honeypotting. Please refer
  to the documentation for further information (2014.11.16).
- New configuration directive to limit the maximum allowable filesize of files
  to be quarantined added (2014.11.16).
- Within the quarantine functionality, improved salting of filenames and
  improved neutralisation of file contents (2014.11.19).
- Added some new signatures to help deal with malicious filedroppers and
  banking trojans (2014.11.19).
- Updated the Preamble (or "Pre-Ramble") included in the documentation, the
  header comment of all included script files (Core, Updater, Language Data)
  and in the archive comment header to slightly better reflect recent changes
  and to slightly improve readability (2014.11.19).
- New configuration directive added to protect against an unconfirmed but
  vital theoretical vulnerability that -could've- potentially existed within
  the new quarantine and honeypot functionality of phpMussel, limiting the
  maximum allowable memory usage of the contents of the quarantine. Refer to
  the documentation for more details (2014.11.19).
- Added fallback function for "scandir" within the Core Script (scandir is used
  by the CLI functionality of phpMussel) for greater backwards-compatibility
  with versions of PHP prior to version 5 (2014.11.20).
- Discovered that the ClamAV signatures database had two additional sections to
  it that seem to be entirely undocumented in their signatures database
  whitepaper at the moment, which I hadn't noticed before until today, upon
  the routine ClamAV signatures update prior to the new version release. These
  two additional sections, respectively, deal with infected PDF documents and
  infected SWF (Shockwave Flash) files. As such, I've now added support for
  both of these to phpMussel, meaning that phpMussel now has sections to deal
  specifically with PDF documents and SWF files (2014.11.21).
- New configuration directives added to reflect the aforementioned changes
  brought about as of this version release (2014.11.21).
- Found some new SWF and VBS malware droppers. Added signatures to protect
  against them (2014.11.21).
- Added a new testfile for the purposes of testing against the new PDF
  signatures sets (2014.11.21).
- Updated to the the latest ClamAV signatures; PhishTank signatures; All other
  signatures and etc (2014.11.21).
- As per usual, all documentation updated to reflect the changes brought about
  as of this version release (2014.11.21).

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- Due to the significant number of changes between the previous version and
  this version, coupled with my having intentions to completely overhaul the
  (semi-)auto-update procedure at some point hopefully between now and the next
  minor version release (no promises), for the time being, I've taken down the
  auto-update sources used by the Update script. Hope this isn't inconvenient.
  The Update script remains included with the package, and is not capable of
  causing any harm or problems, but attempts to use it will likely just
  time-out or result in a 404 until I get around to putting those sources back
  online again.  For the time being, for updating to this current version and
  any consequent future version releases, until further notice, just do it
  manually (download the package, extract the files, reupload the updated files
  and so forth). Cheers.

=== Version/Release 0.5c (Previous Release: 0.5b; Next: 0.6) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+19571+5c).
Sub-minor release (medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- A new round and strengthening of the HTML defacement signatures and
  various other new signatures; A few XXE; The latest ClamAV signatures;
  PhishTank signatures; All other signatures and etc (2014.11.02).
- With the release of v0.4d, I'd implemented the ability for signatures to
  trigger or not trigger based upon the value of variables available to the
  scope of the core script core scanning function. To make better use of that
  implementation, I've extended on the actual variables available. I've already
  made use of this with some of the phpMussel signatures that I've written up.
  The extending of this implementation will mostly be of benefit to those that
  write their own custom signatures, having little to no consequence for anyone
  else (2014.11.02).
- General minor optimisation of the code of the Core Script (2014.11.02).

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- Going over all code, I'd discovered that signatures that are both flagged
  with "A" and containing the ">" marker at the same time (there aren't very
  many that fit this criteria though), although to-date, I've received exactly
  zero reports of false positives, could, in theory, potentially cause
  false positives in certain situations, due to the way the code was structured
  allowing for those signatures to occasionally capture slightly more or less
  widely (depending on the signature in question) than intended; This affects
  all signatures, both regex and non-regex (but does not affect those signature
  types where such markers are not used, such as the MD5 Signatures or PE
  Sectional signatures); Fixed (2014.11.02).

=== Version/Release 0.5b (Previous Release: 0.5a; Next: 0.5c) ===
SUMMARY:
Non-ClamAV signatures update only (55+19521+5b).
Sub-minor release (medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- I've written up and will be including a signatures tally breakdown with the
  documentation as of this release, for the benefit of those that may have
  any interest in monitoring net-shifts in signature quantities (2014.10.25).
- As of this release, phpMussel supports XDP files and XML/XDP-chunk
  signatures. ClamAV recently (just this month) did something similar, so,
  although it isn't yet documented that the ClamAV signatures database
  distinguishes XML/XDP-chunk or XDP-based signatures as their own distinct
  signature type, I -suspect- that this will probably happen (although I can't
  be certain) in the near future. Additionally, as it is, although phpMussel
  doesn't currently support the ClamAV logical signatures format or syntax,
  I've noticed that a small handful of them seem to be targeting the same sort
  of things that the XML/XDP-chunk signatures would be intending to be
  targeting, so, I've rewritten those particular signatures as so that they
  may be included (attribution maintain to ClamAV) with the phpMussel
  XML/XDP-chunk signatures (2014.10.26).
- XML/XDP chunks are treated in the same manner as whole files would be in so
  far as the MD5 hash signatures are concerned, as so that malicious files
  that'd normally be flagged via those MD5 hash signatures will be flagged
  regardless of whether they are being scanned as actual whole files or as
  XML/XDP chunks (2014.10.26).
- New configuration directives added to reflect the aforementioned changes
  brought about as of this version release (2014.10.27).
- A new round and strengthening of the HTML defacement signatures (2014.10.27).
- As per usual, all documentation updated to reflect the changes brought about
  as of this version release (2014.10.28).
- Although the problem appeared to be fixed when I'd released v0.5a, for
  whatever reason, it appears that ClamAV is once again hosting an outdated
  copy of the daily signatures, therefore, unfortunately, there will be no
  updates to ClamAV's signatures between v0.5a and v0.5b, but, that said,
  signatures have otherwise had updates; New PhishTank signatures, updates
  to those signatures from other sources and the likes (2014.10.28).

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- Spotted a typographical error in one of the directive description comments
  within the phpMussel configuration (note: error affects neither code nor
  signatures); Fixed (2014.10.27).

=== Version/Release 0.5a (Previous Release: 0.5.1; Next: 0.5b) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+19521+5a).
Sub-minor release (high priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- Big number of new signatures included with this release! A number of
  signatures crafted for the purposes of combating defacement attacks against
  websites and servers making use of phpMussel.
- Added some new defacement signatures sourced from Spambot Security and a new
  round of signatures designed to protect against hacking and exploitation
  attempts.
- Added some new email scamming and email phishing signatures as well as, as
  per the usual, a new round of PhishTank derived signatures.
- Added a number of the open-source signatures provided by NLNetLabs.

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- There were two new signatures that I'd written for the previous release that
  I'd forgotten to hex-encode. Luckily, they didn't consist of anything
  potentially executable. My apologies! They were smaller, more obscure
  signatures to detect for some specific base64 encoded data and this oversight
  isn't remotely dangerous, so there's nothing to worry about, at least.
  Must've missed them because the coded and unencoded versions of the
  signatures looked very similar to each other in this instance. Anyhow, fixed.
- There was an incorrectly placed operand in the section of the Core Script for
  handling HTML signatures causing that section to never trigger (meaning HTML
  signatures would never be checked against). Fixed. Also, although the change
  is extremely small, the effect is rather significant; I'm marking this
  release as high priority.

=== Version 0.5 / Release 0.5.1 (Previous Release: 0.5; Next: 0.5a) ===
SUMMARY:
Non-ClamAV signatures update only (55+19429+5.1).
No script changes (high or medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- For reasons that I do not know, it appears that the mirror for the ClamAV
  database from which I usually obtain the daily signature updates is currently
  hosting an outdated copy of the daily signatures from a few months back,
  which is older than the signatures already implemented to phpMussel.
  Hopefully this problem will be resolved prior to my intended date for the
  next release after this one, but for this release, at least, I'm not going to
  make any changes to phpMussel's ClamAV signature files. That said, although
  there hasn't been any changes to the core code for phpMussel nor to the
  ClamAV signature files since the previous release, I have written some new
  signatures based on my own research that may be of extreme interest to a
  select few of phpMussel's users, due to what these signatures are intended to
  protect against, which I think warrants the existence of this current
  release. These new signatures primarily concern PHP-specific shell hacks,
  backdoors and several website defacement tools and related indicators.

This release should be considered HIGH PRIORITY if:
- You are allowing the upload of script-based files such as PHP and HTML files,
  and/or if your phpmussel.ini does not explicitly deny them (this includes if
  you have a website that makes use of some sort of web-based self-update
  functionality or similar).
- You do not have any form of file upload sanitization in place or if phpMussel
  is the only defence against dangerous file uploads that you are using.
- Any chameleon attack detection directives are disabled at all.

Otherwise, this release should be considered MEDIUM PRIORITY.

This release is available both as a FULL version (containing all phpMussel
files, as per the norm) and as a CHANGED FILES version (containing only those
files modified since the previous release).

=== Version/Release 0.5 (Previous Release: 0.4d; Next: 0.5.1) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+19429+5).
Minor release (medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- Completed translation of the documentation to Portuguese, with which,
  phpMussel now fully supports six languages (English, French, Italian,
  Indonesian, Portuguese, German) and partially supports an additional two.
  Refer spambotsecurity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=57&t=2929 (2014.09.18).
- Added the compatibility directive, "only_allow_images" (by default,
  deactivated). If you only expect or only intend to allow images to be
  uploaded to your system or CMS, and if you absolutely do not require any
  files other than images to be uploaded to your system or CMS, this
  directive should be switched ON, but should otherwise be switched OFF. If
  this directive is switched ON, it will instruct phpMussel to indiscriminately
  block any uploads identified as non-image files, without scanning them. This
  may reduce processing time and memory usage for attempted uploads of
  non-image files (2014.09.20).
- Added inclusion of PE Sectional Signatures reconstructions to scan_kills
  logging for when PE file uploads are attempted and blocked (2014.09.22).
- Added the ability for phpMussel to detect the presence of and decode unpack()
  commands, that specify the "H*" format, from within file uploads (extending
  upon the decoding abilities added to phpMussel within the previous version).
  I've also added more to the number of signatures that make use of these
  abilities, allowing phpMussel to protect against a wider-range of popular
  server and web-based rootkits than the previous version (2014.09.24).
- Success! As of this version, phpMussel supports OLE2 signatures. I believe
  that implementation has been done correctly, that it should be working
  correctly and I've not theorised any clear potential problems, although,
  given the range of different file formats that the OLE2 signatures are
  supposed to cover, my lack of access to adequate sample pools to test it
  against leads me to suggest that I'm only likely to know for sure once I've
  released it and have received feedback from users. On that note, if you do
  encounter any problems, please let me know about it. With support for OLE2
  signatures now implemented, the only ClamAV signatures that aren't yet
  supported by phpMussel are the logical multi-extended signatures, the
  safe browsing signatures and the bitwise/android signatures, which comprise
  an exceptionally small number of signatures - The vast majority of signatures
  are now supported. There are still a few things yet to be done, but phpMussel
  is getting very close now to the targets set for the eventual "v1.0" release.
- The inline mapping used for most non-ClamAV signatures was beginning to
  become unmanageable for the non-ClamAV mail signatures ("mail_mussel_*.cvd")
  due to both the large number of signatures it contains and the frequency of
  changes made to it between releases, so, in order to make things easier, for
  that particular file, I've opted to use the same signature mapping method I'd
  been using for most ClamAV signatures for that particular file (external
  ".map" file).
- Slightly improved multilingual support for the Update Script ("update.inc").
- Significant increase in the number of signatures used throughout, both for
  ClamAV and non-ClamAV signatures and for most signature types.
- All documentation updated to reflect the changes brought about as of this
  version of phpMussel.

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- There existed a bug whereby when a file upload was blocked for multiple
  reasons, and if scan_kills logging was enabled, that the same MD5 signature
  reconstruction would repeat as many times as how many reasons there were,
  instead of just the once; Fixed (2014.09.22).

=== Version/Release 0.4d (Previous Release: 0.4c; Next: 0.5) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+19354+4d).
Sub-minor release (medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- Modified code for checking against graphics signatures as so that phpMussel
  now checks signatures against both normalised and verbatim content (whereas
  previously, it only checked against verbatim content) in order to harden
  defences against a few particularly nasty known threats.
- Added the ability for phpMussel to detect the presence of and decode Base64,
  GZ, ROT13 and Hex2Bin decode commands within file uploads, thus allowing
  phpMussel to understand and scan such encoded data (when detected and
  decoded correctly). This has allowed me to write a few additional signatures
  for improved defences against known threats.
- Changed the way in which phpMussel reads the actual raw content of files in
  the hopes of improving performance and speed (this has resulted in the
  addition of a new function within the Core Script). Comparing the before and
  the after of this change, I have noticed a slight improvement, but it isn't
  significant and doesn't entirely satisfy me yet. Will likely try to develop
  this further throughout some consequent releases.
- Added the ability for phpMussel to optionally check against custom signatures
  based upon the values of variables available to the scope of the core
  scanning function of the Core Script. This ability functions similarly to how
  other conditional signature checks function.
- Added the ability to whitelist specific files via MD5 hash and filesize, in a
  similar manner to how the MD5 and PE Sectional scanning functions. With this,
  the whitelist entries included with the ClamAV signatures are now supported.
  However, as most of the entries included with the ClamAV signatures are very
  vaguely described and it appeared difficult to determine what most of those
  whitelist entries were actually for, only a very small handful of them have
  been included with phpMussel (those that I could adequately determine what
  they were most likely for and for which I was adequately confident would not
  provide any potential weaknesses to the defences provided by phpMussel).
  Refer to the README documentation for more details on how this file
  whitelisting ability works.
- Numerous other minor changes to the Core Script (phpmussel.inc).
- A few additional directives added to the phpMussel configuration.
- decode_threshold: Optional limitation to the length of raw data within which
  decode commands should be detected (in case there are any noticeable
  performance issues whilst scanning).
- scannable_threshold: Optional limitation to the length of raw data to which
  phpMussel is permitted to read and scan (in case there are any noticeable
  performance issues whilst scanning).
- Directives pertaining to the new whitelisting ability.
- Shifted a small handful of phpMussel signatures from the General signatures
  files to the ASCII signatures files for improved detection.
- All documentation updated to reflect the changes brought about as of this
  version of phpMussel.

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- Corrected a bug whereby scanning for a specific file via CLI mode would
  trigger the false-positive, "phpMussel-FN.Illegal.Character-5C", due to the
  inherent presence of forward-slashes in the full-path.
- A minor translation correction done to the Language Data; PT (lang.inc).

=== Version/Release 0.4c (Previous Release: 0.4b; Next: 0.4d) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+19312+4c).
Sub-minor release (medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- Partially rewrote the code for checking against archive metadata signatures,
  with which, as opposed to the previous release of that code whereby only
  the formats GZ and ZIP were supported, now, it additionally supports the
  formats BZ and LZF (although, certain PECL extensions of php will be required
  in order for that additional supported to be functional; absence of those
  PECL extensions will prevent that additional support from being functional,
  though, such absences will have no adverse effect otherwise and phpMussel
  will continue to function normally regardlessly).
- Minor non-significant code optimisations of the Loader (phpmussel.php).
- Although the case is much the same as is with the implementation of support
  for the normalised ASCII signatures introduced in the previous release, for
  this release, I've implemented partial support for the normalised HTML
  signatures of ClamAV. No changes have been made for this release to the
  actual normalisation method I coded for the previous release, though, owing
  to some minor rethinking and improving of my actual method of preparing
  signatures from the ClamAV database for inclusion with phpMussel, the actual
  total number of signatures between the previous release and this release has
  increased significantly, from the previous ~150 signatures to the current
  ~1,300 for normalised ASCII signatures and to ~1,900 for the normalised HTML
  signatures.

=== Version/Release 0.4b (Previous Release: 0.4a; Next: 0.4c) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+19279+4b).
Sub-minor release (medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- Many thanks to BlueEyed Zebra, who has successfully translated to German the
  entirety of the phpMussel documentation and the phpMussel internal language
  data, with which, phpMussel is now fully supported in the German language.
  With the addition of German, phpMussel now -fully- supports five languages
  (English, French, Indonesian, Italian, German) and -partially- supports an
  additional three (Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch; All three, internal language
  data has been fully translated but translation of the documentation is very
  incomplete).
  Refer spambotsecurity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=57&t=2929 (2014.08.05).
- I've -began- working on support for the normalised ASCII signatures, and what
  I've coded thus far is working correctly, though I wouldn't call it anywhere
  near complete yet. Currently, the normalisation method that I've written
  isn't entirely identical to that which is employed by ClamAV (and thus that
  which the normalised ASCII signatures of ClamAV are written in mind with),
  and ideally, at the least, what I write should eventually either mimic or
  improve on that which is employed by ClamAV. That said, I haven't been
  working on this part of phpMussel for a particularly long time yet and it's
  certain to improve with time, and as is, still does a reasonable job. Not
  all of the relevant signatures match in the same way between ClamAV and
  phpMussel yet, but those that do (and thus, which should correctly match
  during scans by phpMussel without false positives) have been included
  with this release (which works out to roughly ~150 signatures of the total
  ~3K±K or so normalised ASCII signatures available from ClamAV).
  Part of the reason that I'm including it with this release, as opposed to
  waiting until I've got it 100% implemented in the way that I'm aiming for,
  is that there are some critical common CMS vulnerabilities that can be
  protected against by inclusion of a number of signatures that, at the least,
  require the level of implementation that I've currently achieved, but which
  I don't think I should hold back on for some unknown future date, thus,
  releasing where it's currently at. In any case, it shouldn't cause problems.
- Minor non-significant code optimisations of the Core Script (phpmussel.inc).
  No changes to the Language Data (lang.inc) or Update Script (update.inc)
  exist between this and the previous version.

=== Version/Release 0.4a (Previous Release: 0.4; Next: 0.4b) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+19260+4a).
Sub-minor release (medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- General commands CSV tweaked slightly (hex_general_commands.csv).
- As usual, improved signature set.

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- Missing break statement from end of looped section in update script would
  cause forced update via CLI to infinitely loop (update.inc); Fixed.
- Corrected some minor spelling errors in the language file (lang.inc).

=== Version/Release 0.4 (Previous Release: 0.3g.1; Next: 0.4a) ===
SUMMARY:
Updated to the latest signatures set (55+19164+4).
Minor release (medium priority).

NEW CHANGES:
- All script files and constituent content heavily modified between this
  and the previous version (language data, updater script, code script).
- Slightly improved detection method for graphics files and associated
  signatures; Support for a few additional graphics formats added.
- Slightly improved detection method for PE files and associated signatures.
- Slightly improved chameleon attack detection; Support for a few additional
  formats added.
- A few additional directives added to the phpMussel configuration.
- corrupted_exe: Option to detect and block potentially corrupted PE files.
- Success! A lot of reading up on format specifications and a lot of messing
  around trying different things with php later, I've managed to implement
  support for PE Sectional MD5 signatures! As of this version (v0.4), phpMussel
  can now check individual sections of PE files against the ClamAV PE Sectional
  MD5 signatures. :-)
  The code itself works like a charm, but unfortunately, due to the sheer size
  of the PE Sectional signatures of the ClamAV database, isn't yet entirely
  problem free. To explain the problem.. The physical size of the previous
  latest version of phpMussel (v0.3g.1), compressed, is 4.26 MBs, and
  uncompressed, is 13.2 MBs. The current physical size of the entirety of the
  mainlined PE Sectional signatures, by themselves, not including anything else
  at all, uncompressed, is.. 131.52 MBs. Daily and mains PE Sectional
  signatures combined, and processed for use with phpMusel, uncompressed, is...
  217.9 MBs. The sum of those two figures (13.2 MBs + 217.9 MBs) is 231.1 MBs,
  which is about 17-fold (or 1,700%) greater than the first figure by itself.
  A rather unpalatable increase, in my mind, and a problem that I'm not yet
  entirely sure how to deal with in the long term. For now, as a temporary
  (acceptable, but not absolutely perfect) solution (and because I wanted to
  get this release out without too much delay and needed some sort of solution
  prior to doing so), the PE Sectional signatures of ClamAV included with this
  release cover the 300,000 PE Sectional signatures most recently released by
  ClamAV, which is a rather significant number, but still far short of the
  total 3,344,332 PE Sectional signatures that exist in the current mains+daily
  release of the ClamAV database. Because of this reduction, the total filesize
  of the pe_clamav.cvd should be significantly smaller (20.5 MBs) than it'd
  otherwise be, and although not being comprehensive, at least, will run
  correctly, not crash php due to excessive memory usage and will provide a
  notable degree of protection against at least the latest known PE Sectional
  infection vectors. For more details, or, if you have any ideas to offer...

- Added additional functionality to the CLI mode of phpMussel: Previously, it
  was only possible to update phpMussel either manually or via browser-based
  commands; It is now possible to update phpMussel via CLI mode; It is also now
  possible to generate signatures via CLI mode, in a similar fashion to how it
  is possible to generate signatures for ClamAV via their sigtool utility, and
  it is now possible to display and modify the greylist via CLI mode. Refer to
  the documentation for more details.
- Loader slightly modified (updating recommended).
- Included documentation updated to reflect the changes of this version.
- Updated existing testfiles and added one new testfile.
- As usual, improved signature set.

PROBLEMS/BUGS FIXED:
- Greylist clear command bugged; Didn't work (hastily coded first time; made
  some silly mistakes that were easy to fix, but didn't spot them until the
  latest round of testing); Fixed.
- Incorrect suggested update date displayed upon update abort; Fixed.

« Entries prior to 0.4 (8th July 2014) redacted from this release of the
  change_log to keep the size of the change_log to a manageable level and due
  to those entries having only limited relevance to the most recently available
  release of phpMussel. Older releases will still contain those older entries
  where relevant and those entries should nonetheless be available for viewing
  via the support forums release information thread and via older commits of
  the change_log. »
